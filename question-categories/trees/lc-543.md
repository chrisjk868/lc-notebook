Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**  

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)

Input: `root = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: `3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `root = [1,2]`  
Output: `1`

## Solution
```python
def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    ans = [0]
    def dfs(node):
        # At every node:
        #   - Compute the maximal length of the path that reaches the current node from:
        #   1. The left subtree
        #   2. The right subtree
        if not node:
            return 0
        # Max path on left to curr node
        left_path_len = dfs(node.left)
        # Max path on right to curr node
        right_path_len = dfs(node.right)
        # Max path from a node in left subtree to right subtree combined
        ans[0] = max(ans[0], left_path_len + right_path_len)
        return 1 + max(left_path_len, right_path_len)
    dfs(root)
    return ans[0]
