Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

---
**Example 1:**  
Input: `head = [1,2,-3,3,1]`  
Output: `[3, 1]`  
Note: `The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.`  

**Example 2:**   
Input: `head = [1,2,-3,3,4]`  
Output: `[1, 2, 4]`    

**Example 3:**   
Input: `head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]`  
Output: `[1]`

## Intuition
For this problem the intuition is pretty straightforward. As soon as we detect that a sequence of numbers within
the linked list sums up to a zero consecutively, we would delete that section of the linked list. With
this problem it would be effective to use a hashmap which allows us to store pointers that references
each individual node within the linked list.

In a sense it is similar to finding the subarray sum of an array that sums to a target of zero. If we
recall this from before we know that if we were to simply record the current prefix sums up until the
current point we would be able to figure out exactly which subarrays sums exactly to zero.

As we iterate through our linked list if our current sum is seen within our hashmap of pointers 
`prefix_sum -> ListNode()` then we could say that for the current prefix sum if we were to subtract
`hashmap[prefix_sum]` from it we would yield `0`.

When we encounter the above scenario we would start from the position of the pointer in our hashmap that
equals our current `prefix_sum` and also keep track of the node that is directly after `cur`. We would make
`cur.nex = temp`, which in effect skips over the segment of the linked list which sums to zero. Then
we want to also iterate over that segment and delete pointers existing in our current hashmap that
point to positions in the deleted segment.  

---
## Implementation
With our implementation we will need to use a dictionary to keep track of the `prefix_sum` at each
segment of the LL and have a pointer that points to their respective positions. Additionally, it
would also be useful to have a sentinel node at the beginning which will be our `ans` by returning `ans.next`.
Lastly, we will use a while loop to iterate over the nodes of the linked list and make relevant changes.

## Solution
```python
def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    ans = ListNode(0, head)
    cur = ans.nex
    prefix_sum = 0
    prefix = {0: ans}
    while cur:
        prefix_sum += cur.val
        if prefix_sum not in prefix:
            prefix[prefix_sum] = cur
        else:
            node = prefix[prefix_sum]
            # Delete all nodes in dict between node.next to cur inclusive
            temp = node.next
            cur_sum = prefix_sum + temp.val
            while cur_sum != prefix_sum:
                del prefix[cur_sum]
                temp = temp.next
                cur_sum += temp.val
            node.next = cur.next
            cur = node
        cur = cur.next
    return ans.next
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input linked list `head`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

The runtime complexity here would be linear because we are only traversing over the given linked list
at most once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

The space complexity here would be linear because as we traverse through our linked list most elements
that our hashmap would have would be $N$ unique elements that all stores object references to different
positions of the linked list which only takes $\mathcal{O}(1)$ space each.
