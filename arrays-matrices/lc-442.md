Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

---
**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`  
Output: `[2,3]`    

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[1,1,2]`  
Output: `[1]`  

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[1]`  
Output: `[]`

## Intuition
For this problem if we intend to solve it in linear time and constant space we could try to alter the existing elements of the given `nums` array. With array problems whenever the problem wants us to solve them in-place without using any extra space we could always consider this approach because using a hashmap to store additional information would be out of the question for us.

The approach is to somehow convey if any element within `nums`, being `nums[i]` has been seen or not by our algorithm as we iterate through the array. We could do this by somehow relating the actual `nums[i]` with `i`, and changing the **state** of `nums[i]` to convey this information. Since being seen or not seen is binary in nature **state** of `nums[i]` will be either if the number is positive or negative.

With the above in mind let's say that, if `nums[i]` is negative then this means that the number `i` has been seen, and conversely if `nums[i]` is positive this means that the number `i` hasn't been seen yet as we iterate through the `nums` array. Therefore, This means that we could just iterate through `nums` as is and at every `i` make `nums[i]` negative if it is positive, if we see that `nums[i]` is already negative then that means the number `i` is a duplicate value within `nums` and we can append `i` to our `ans` and return that at the very end.

\**Watch out for off by one error*\* with `i`. This would be explained in the implementation

---
## Implementation
`ans` to return all duplicate numbers seen as we iterate through `nums` with a for loop.

We would always look at `nums[abs(i) - 1]`, because we want to be able to account for all number up until `n` as stated in the problem. If take `nums[abs(i)]` as is we wouldn't be able to track the `n`-th number for a `nums` with length `n`. In this case the mapping of i to the actual representation of values is all offset by, which is as follows `(i -> actual value): (0 -> 1), (1 -> 2), ... , (len(nums) - 1 -> n)`.

---
## Solution
```python
def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    ans = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if nums[abs(num) - 1] > 0:
            nums[abs(num) - 1] *= -1
        else:
            ans.append(abs(num))
    return ans
```
---
## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input array `nums`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Linear time because we are iterating pass every element in `nums` at most once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(1)$

Constant space because no extra space is being used.
