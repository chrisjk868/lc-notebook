Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`  
Output: `[2,3]`    

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[1,1,2]`  
Output: `[1]`  

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[1]`  
Output: `[]`

## Intuition
For this problem if we intend to solve it in linear time and constant space we could try to alter the existing elements of the given `nums` array. With array problems whenever the problem wants us to solve them in-place without using any extra space we could always consider this approach because using a hashmap to store additional information would be out of the question for us.

The approach is to somehow convey if any element within `nums`, being `nums[i]` has been seen or not by our algorithm as we iterate through the array. We could do this by somehow relating the actual `nums[i]` with `i`, and changing the **state** of `nums[i]` to convey this information. Since being seen or not seen is binary in nature **state** of `nums[i]` will be either if the number is positive or negative.

With this above in mind let's say that, if `nums[i]` is negative then this means that the number `i` has been seen, and conversely if `nums[i]` is positive this means that the number `i` hasn't been seen yet as we iterate through the `nums` array.

## Solution
```python
def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    ans = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if nums[abs(num) - 1] > 0:
            nums[abs(num) - 1] *= -1
        else:
            ans.append(abs(num))
    return ans
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input array `nums`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Linear time because we are iterating pass every element in `nums` at most once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(1)$

Constant space because no extra space is being used.
