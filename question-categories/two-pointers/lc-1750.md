Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:

1. Pick a **non-empty** prefix from the string `s` where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
2. Pick a **non-empty** suffix from the string `s` where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
3. The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
4. The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
5. Delete both the prefix and the suffix.  

Return the **minimum length** of `s` after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times).

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "ca"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `You can't remove any characters, so the string stays as is.`  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "cabaabac"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:
```
An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "c" and suffix = "c" and remove them, s = "abaaba".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "baab".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "b" and remove them, s = "aa".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "".
```

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "aabccabba"`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation:
```
An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "aa" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "bccabb".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "bb" and remove them, s = "cca".
```

## Intuition
For this problem the first thing that came into mind is 2 pointers and the way that I like going about is to think about different scenarios: 
> 3 Scenarios:
> 1. `if s[l] == s[l + 1] and s[r] == s[r - 1]` ~ If the preceding and succeeding characters match up on both ends we would want to consider every character in between them. So we can set the left character as the target character and decrement `r` pointer to count as many characters that match `s[l]`.
> 2. `if s[l] != s[l + 1] and s[r] == s[r - 1]` ~ If the preceding character on the left doesn't match and succeeding character on the right matches we would do the same and decrement `r` to count all instances of characters on the right which matches `s[l]`.
> 3. `if s[l] == s[l + 1] and s[r] != s[r - 1]` ~ If the preceding character on the left matches but the succeeding character on the right doesn't we would want to set `s[r]` as the target character and count all instances of the characters on the left by incrementing `l` to see if they match with `s[r]`.
> 4. `if s[l] != s[l + 1] and s[r] != s[r - 1]` ~ If both the preceding and succeeding characters don't match up but are the same `s[l] == s[r]` then increment `l` and decrement `r` by one and terminate the algorithm.

Since we want to none overlapping indices our `l` and `r` pointers would not equate to each other at any point in time. We also want to make sure the `s[l] == s[r]` or else this would mean that we can't pick any suffix or prefix from `s` that consists of the same characters.

---
## Implementation
Our implementation is just like any other 2 pointer question except this time we would have `l < r` as we don't want overlapping indices and also we want to always make sure `s[l] == s[r]` to be sure that both prefix and suffix characters are the same on both ends within our while loop.

**Extremes and edge cases:**
- An edge case would be in the case that we have something like `acccccca` the `cccccc` would fail to count the last `c` character on the very left as a removable character as we aren't counting `c` when its previous character is `a` in `ac` but the `c` is still part of `cccccc` so we would need to count it as a removable character only if the unchanged character at `s[l]` is the same as the current right pointer character at `s[r]`.

## Solution
```python
def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
    # 2 Pointers approach:
    rmv = 0
    l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
    while s[l] == s[r] and l < r: # Non-overlapping indexes
        pivot_l, pivot_r = (s[l] == s[l + 1]), (s[r] == s[r - 1])
        if (pivot_l and pivot_r) or (not pivot_l and pivot_r):
            # Set left char as target char
            # Decrement right until it isn't matching its preceding char
            while l <= r and s[r] == s[r - 1]:
                r -= 1
                rmv += 1
            # Special edge case
            rmv = rmv + (1 if l == r and s[r] == s[l] else 0)
        elif pivot_l and not pivot_r:
            # Set right char as target char
            # Increment left until it isn't matching its succeding char
            while l <= r and s[l] == s[l + 1]:
                l += 1
                rmv += 1
        else:
            l += 1
            r -= 1
            rmv += 2
    return len(s) - rmv
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the length of input string `s`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

The runtime complexity is linear because both `l` and `r` pointers will iterate through at most $N$ characters exactly once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(1)$

No extra space is used here for this problem so it remains constant.
