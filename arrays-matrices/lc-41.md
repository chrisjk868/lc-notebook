Given an unsorted integer array `nums`. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in `nums`.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` auxiliary space.

---
**Example 1:**  

Input: `nums = [1,2,0]`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: `The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `nums = [3,4,-1,1]`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `1 is in the array but 2 is missing.`  

**Example 3:**  

Input: `nums = [7,8,9,11,12]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: `The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.`

## Intuition
This problem is quite similar to [442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](./lc-442.md). This is because we are actively manipulating existing elements within the array in place in order to convey the information we want and don't need as we iterate. So it would be good to look at the previously mentioned problem first before tackling this problem.

There are a few things that are important to realize. Firstly, we don't really care about negative numbers because we are only concerned with finding the first missing positive number. Secondly, we also don't really care about 0 because it neither positive nor negative. Lastly, we want to find the first **gap** that exists in the positive numbers of `nums` when they are placed in order.

In order to solve this problem in linear time and constant space we could alter existing elements of the `nums` array to reflect the **seen** state of positive numbers within it. Just like **442. Find All Duplicates in an Array** we could mark `nums[i]` negative to signify that the number `i` in `nums` is already seen.

Additionally, it would be very helpful in the beginning to get `max(nums)` and `min(nums)`, because we could iterate through the `nums` array and eliminate any negative values we have by altering their value to be `highest = max(nums) + 2`. Also if we know that if the highest observed values in `nums` is smaller than or equal to zero then we could also just return `1` instantly.

With all of this in mind we can do our first pass of the `nums` array and eliminate all negative numbers with `nums[i] = highest + 2`.

Then in our second pass we could take the absolute value of each value at `i` with `idx = abs(nums[i]) - 1` and mark `nums[idx]` as negative if we haven't seen it before (`if nums[idx] > 0`), and checking that `idx` is within bounds of `nums` (`if idx < len(nums)`). This is because we have to handle the case where `nums[i] = highest + 2` because they represent negative numbers.

In our third pass, we can iterate through `nums` and for the first `nums[i]` that is negative we can return `i + 1` this is because we are representing all number off by 1 with `idx = abs(nums[i]) - 1`, meaning `(actual number -> i) ~ (1 -> 0, 2 -> 1, ..., len(nums) -> len(nums) - 1)`

Lastly, if we don't manage to find any values in our existing `nums` array to be negative then this means that the first missing positive number exists right after `highest`. So we could just return `highest + 1` at the very end outside of all the for loops.


---
## Implementation
We can just use three for loops for the three passes we are doing and remember in the last for loop to return `i + 1` at the very first `nums[i]` that isn't negative.

---
## Solution
```python
def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    highest = max(nums)
    if highest <= 0:
        return 1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] <= 0:
            nums[i] = highest + 2
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        idx = abs(nums[i]) - 1
        if idx < len(nums):
            nums[idx] *= -1 if nums[idx] > 0 else 1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > 0:
            return i + 1
    return highest + 1
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input array `nums`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Runtime is linear because we are only at most iterating through each element of `nums` once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(1)$

No extra space here is used so it is constant.
