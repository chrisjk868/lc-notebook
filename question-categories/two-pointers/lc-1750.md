Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:

1. Pick a **non-empty** prefix from the string `s` where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
2. Pick a **non-empty** suffix from the string `s` where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
3. The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
4. The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
5. Delete both the prefix and the suffix.  

Return the **minimum length** of `s` after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times).

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "ca"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `You can't remove any characters, so the string stays as is.`  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "cabaabac"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:
```
An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "c" and suffix = "c" and remove them, s = "abaaba".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "baab".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "b" and remove them, s = "aa".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "".
```

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "aabccabba"`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation:
```
An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "aa" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "bccabb".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "bb" and remove them, s = "cca".
```

## Solution
```python
def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
    # 2 Pointers approach:
    rmv = 0
    l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
    while s[l] == s[r] and l < r: # Non-overlapping indexes
        pivot_l, pivot_r = (s[l] == s[l + 1]), (s[r] == s[r - 1])
        if (pivot_l and pivot_r) or (not pivot_l and pivot_r):
            # Set left char as target char
            # Decrement right until it isn't matching its preceding char
            while l <= r and s[r] == s[r - 1]:
                r -= 1
                rmv += 1
            # Special edge case
            rmv = rmv + (1 if l == r and s[r] == s[l] else 0)
        elif pivot_l and not pivot_r:
            # Set right char as target char
            # Increment left until it isn't matching its succeding char
            while l <= r and s[l] == s[l + 1]:
                l += 1
                rmv += 1
        else:
            l += 1
            r -= 1
            rmv += 2
    return len(s) - rmv
```
