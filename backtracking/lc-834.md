There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given the integer `n` and the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between the `i-th` node in the tree and all other nodes.
