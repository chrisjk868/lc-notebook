You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:  
- The length of the subarray is `k`, and
- All the elements of the subarray are distinct.  

Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.

*A ***subarray*** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.*

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3`  
Output: `15`  
Explanation:
```
The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
```

**Example 2:**
Input: `nums = [4,4,4], k = 3`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:
```
The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.

## Solution
```python
def maximumSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    # Sliding Window:
    # In our window track the numbers in the window, length of window and current sum
    start = 0
    curr_sum = 0
    ans = 0
    freq = {}
    for end in range(len(nums)):
        curr_sum += nums[end]
        if nums[end] not in freq:
            freq[nums[end]] = 1
        else:
            freq[nums[end]] += 1
        # Ensure that values in window range is distinct
        while freq[nums[end]] > 1:
            curr_sum -= nums[start]
            freq[nums[start]] -= 1
            start += 1
            if freq[nums[start]] < 0:
                del freq[nums[start]]
        # Ensure that window size is always k
        if (end - start) + 1 >= k:
            if (end - start) + 1 > k:
                curr_sum -= nums[start]
                del freq[nums[start]]
                start += 1
            ans = max(ans, curr_sum)
    return ans
