You start with an initial power of `power`, an initial score of `0`, and a bag of tokens given as an integer array `tokens`, where each `tokens[i]` donates the value of $token_i$.

Your goal is to **maximize** the total score by strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):  

- **Face-up:** If your current power is at least `tokens[i]`, you may play $token_i$, losing `tokens[i]` power and gaining `1` score.  
- **Face-down:** If your current score is at least `1`, you may play $token_i$, gaining `tokens[i]` power and losing `1` score.  

Return the **maximum** possible score you can achieve after playing **any** number of tokens.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `tokens = [100], power = 50`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: 
Since your score is `0` initially, you cannot play the token face-down. You also cannot play it face-up since your power (`50`) is less than `tokens[0]` (`100`).

**Example 2:**  
Input: `tokens = [200,100], power = 150`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation:  Play $token_1$ (`100`) face-up, reducing your power to `50` and increasing your score to `1`.  
There is no need to play $token_0$, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is `1`.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  Play the tokens in this order to get a score of `2`:
1. Play $token_0$ (`100`) face-up, reducing power to `100` and increasing score to `1`.
2. Play $token_3$ (`400`) face-down, increasing power to `500` and reducing score to `0`.
3. Play $token_1$ (`200`) face-up, reducing power to `300` and increasing score to `1`.
4. Play $token_2$ (`300`) face-up, reducing power to `0` and increasing score to `2`.  

The maximum score achievable is `2`.

## Solution
```python
def bagOfTokensScore(self, tokens: List[int], power: int) -> int:
    tokens.sort()
    l, r = 0, len(tokens) - 1
    ans = 0
    curr_score = 0
    while l <= r:
        # If score is less than one then you have to gain score by playing face up
        if curr_score < 1:
            if power >= tokens[l]:
                power -= tokens[l]
                curr_score += 1
                ans = max(ans, curr_score)
                l += 1
            else:
                return ans
        else:
            if power >= tokens[l]:
                power -= tokens[l]
                curr_score += 1
                ans = max(ans, curr_score)
                l += 1
            else:
                power += tokens[r]
                curr_score -= 1
                ans = max(ans, curr_score)
                r -= 1
    return ans
