Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**  

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)

Input: `root = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: `3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `root = [1,2]`  
Output: `1`

## Intuition
Since the diameter of the tree is any longest path that exists between any 2 nodes within the tree, this intuitively says that at every node of the tree we want to find the longest path between an arbitrary node in its left subtree and an arbitrary node in its right subtree.

With this in mind we could do a preorder DFS traversal of the given tree and compute $max(tree_d) = max(left_d) + max(right_d)$. 

We would compute the current max diameter that passes through the current node, and we would also add 1 to the max diameter from either left or right diameters for returning that result to previous recursive calls. This way we would allow our algorithm to consider 3 things.

> 3 Considerations:
> 1. The current max diameter that is built from passing through the current node
> 2. The max diameter that ends at the current node from the left
> 3. The max diameter that ends at the current node from the right
> - Both 2. and 3. allows us to compute 1. in the previous recursive call one level higher in the tree.

## Implementation
The implementation is quite straightforward as we said above we could simply use a preorder DFS traversal which operates in the sequence of visiting left and right, and then computing the result and returning it. 

Keep in mind we do want to add 1 to our $max(left_d, right_d)$ because as we go up one level the path length is always increasing by 1.

**Extremes and edge cases:**
- When we reach a null node we want to return 0 as the a null node has a diameter of 0, and this allows us to build up the maximal diameters on each level of the tree for both its left and right subtrees.

## Solution
```python
def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    ans = [0]
    def dfs(node):
        # At every node:
        #   - Compute the maximal length of the path that reaches the current node from:
        #   1. The left subtree
        #   2. The right subtree
        if not node:
            return 0
        # Max path on left to curr node
        left_path_len = dfs(node.left)
        # Max path on right to curr node
        right_path_len = dfs(node.right)
        # Max path from a node in left subtree to right subtree combined
        ans[0] = max(ans[0], left_path_len + right_path_len)
        return 1 + max(left_path_len, right_path_len)
    dfs(root)
    return ans[0]
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the number of nodes in tree `root`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

In the worst case we traverse an unbalanced tree, and that would lead to a runtime of $N$

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

As in the worst case we would traverse an unbalanced tree and this would in turn lead to us maintaining a stack of $N$ space with $N$ recursive calls.
