Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**  

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

Input: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: `The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: `The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.`

## Intuition
For this problem we can approach the problem in 2 different ways. I will explain both approaches here. I believe the first to be more intuitive, and allows you to figure out the second solution using a monotonic stack.

Firstly, we need to understand how we can find the total amount of water that could be possible trapped at any given index `i`.

We know that the amount of water that could be trapped at a certain index `i` of `height[i]` is determined by

## Solution
**Approach 1:**
```python
def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
    # Construct a prefix and suffix array representing height maxes seen up until now
    p, s = [0] * len(height), [0] * len(height)
    p[0], s[-1] = height[0], height[-1]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, len(height)):
        p[i] = max(height[i], p[i - 1])
    for i in range(len(height) - 2, -1, -1):
        s[i] = max(height[i], s[i + 1])
    for i in range(1, len(height) - 1):
        min_h = min(p[i - 1], s[i + 1])
        ans += min_h - height[i] if min_h > height[i] else 0
    return ans
```

**Approach 2:**
