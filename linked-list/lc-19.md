Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n`-th node from the end of the list and return its head.

---
**Example 1:**  
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)  
Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2`  
Output: `[1,2,3,5]`  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `head = [1], n = 1`  
Output: `[]`  

**Example 3:**  
Input: `head = [1,2], n = 1`  
Output: `[1]`

## Intuition
If we were to solve this problem in 2 passes it would be very easy. The approach would be on the first pass make not of the entire length of the linked list. Then in the second pass iterate to the node that is just before the `n`-th node from the end, which is the connection point to whatever is after the `n`-th node from the end to be deleted.

This is reminiscent of the fast and slow pointers approach however this time both pointers would advance forwards at the same rate. Between the pointer that is further ahead and behind that should maintain a fixed distance apart from each other. If we think about it this way the fast pointer would always reach the end first, and by maintaining both `fast` and `slow` pointers `n` distance apart as we step through the linked list this allows us to find the node that we are deleting exactly, and connect any additional nodes behind the node to be deleted.

There is a specific reason for this, and it could be explained as follows.
> if `fast` and `slow` are `n` distance apart:
> - If linked list has 4 nodes `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 2`
> - `fast` starts at node `[3]`
> - `slow` starts at node `[1]`  
>
> As we step through the linked list at the same rate `fast` reaches the end first and terminates. `slow` pointer's position would be exactly `n` away from the last node in the original linked list. Since we want to delete the `n`-th node from the end of the linked list. This means that the actual node we want to delete would be `n - 1` distance away from the last element in the linked list. We want to stop `n` away from the last element as it allows us to point at the node that right before the node that should be deleted which is `n - 1` distance from the end.

> So this means once we stop the algorithm once the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the linked list our `slow` pointer would stop at the node exactly before the node that should be deleted. And this is exactly what we want.

The `slow` pointer is represents the point where nodes from the first half of the linked list `head` should should persist, and also a point where additional nodes beyond the deletion node which is `slow.next` should connect to at the same time.

If there are nodes beyond the deletion point we could get it with `slow.next.next` and connect it to the current node `slow` with `slow.next = slow.next.next`, which mutates `head`.

---
## Implementation

Since `slow` starts at head, we would first set the distance between `fast` and `slow` a distance of `n` apart by starting off with some preprocessing. We can use a for loop and advance the `slow` pointer by `n` times.

For problems like this it is always useful to keep a reference to the original start of linked list `head` so we don't loose reference to it as we step through with pointers. So in this case I would create a sentinel node at the beginning of `head` and later on return `ans.next`. And this also helps us handle an edge case later pretty well.

Then we would step through the linked list with a while loop until `fast.next` is `None`. This is because we want to stop as soon as the fast pointer is at the last valid element of the linked list.

Lastly, we would link the first half and second half the linked list together if there is any additional data beyond the node to be deleted. As explained before we could use the `slow` pointer as a reference and achieve this.

**Extremes and Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is the same as the actual length of the linked list this means that we want to delete the head of the linked list `head`. So by maintaining a sentinel node and start both pointers from there we could always keep them `n` distance apart. When it comes time to delete the starting node of the given linked list our `fast` pointer would reach the end from the for loop itself and our slow pointer wouldn't have moved at all and remain pointed at the sentinel node. 
- This means that `fast` has reached the end and the node right after `slow` should be deleted, which in this case is the actual start of `head`. This allows us to stop right before `head` so we could also delete the first node of `head` if needed.

## Solution
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    # One pass solution:
    ans = ListNode(None, head)
    fast, slow = ans, ans
    # Preprocessing
    for _ in range(n):
        if fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
    while fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
    slow.next = slow.next.next
    return ans.next
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of the input linked list `head`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

All pointers would only visit each node at most $N$ times and exactly once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(1)$

We only used constant extra space in our algorithm as we didn't make deep copies of the given linked list `head`.
