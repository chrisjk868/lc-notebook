Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

---
**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]`  
Output: `[0,1,9,16,100]`  
Explanation: `After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].`  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]`  
Output: `[4,9,9,49,121]`  

---
## Intuition
The important point here is that we need to realize the differences in terms of order that squaring positive and negative numbers would yield. When we square positive numbers they would remain in the same order, however when we square negative numbers they would be in the reverse order compared to the original if we want elements to be in ascending order.

With a 2 pointers approach we could sort the elements of both squared positive and negative numbers array into a single array in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time.

> 2 Pointers approach of merging 2 sorted array togther:
> - if `pos[p_pointer] >= neg[n_pointer]` append `neg[n_pointer]` to `ans` array
> - if `pos[p_pointer] < neg[n_pointer]` append `pos[p_pointer]` to `ans` array
> ---

After merging both sorted `pos` and `neg` arrays into one overall sorted array `ans` we can just return that as our final answer to the problem.

## Implementation
The implementation is quite straight forward:
- First we would need arrays to store the sorted positive and negative numbers.
- We would also need a final array that stores the final sorted array of both positive and negative squared results combined together.
- Now we can go through the original input array `nums` and square each number accordingly and appending it to the `pos` and `neg` arrays depending on if the original number is positive or negative.
- Remember to reverse the order of negative array as mentioned before.
- With a pointer for both the `pos` and `neg` arrays individually we can step through both arrays and merge it into one overall array `ans` of sorted elements from both.

## Solution
```python
def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # O(N) time solution:
    # - Negative in reverse
    # - Positives in same order
    pos, neg, ans = [], [], []
    p_pointer, n_pointer = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] < 0:
            neg.append(nums[i] ** 2)
        else:
            pos.append(nums[i] ** 2)
    neg = neg[::-1]
    # 2 Pointers
    while p_pointer < len(pos) and n_pointer < len(neg):
        # Compare pos and neg number
        if pos[p_pointer] >= neg[n_pointer]:
            ans.append(neg[n_pointer])
            n_pointer += 1
        else:
            ans.append(pos[p_pointer])
            p_pointer += 1
    # Handle edge cases:
    if p_pointer <= len(pos) - 1:
        ans += pos[p_pointer:]
    elif n_pointer <= len(neg) - 1:
        ans += neg[n_pointer:]
    return ans
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input array `nums`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

We are only processing each element once and merge sorting would also take maximum $N$ operations

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

We are only using maximum $N$ space with `pos`, `neg` and `ans` arrays
