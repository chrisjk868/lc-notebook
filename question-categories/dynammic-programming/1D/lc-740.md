You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and every element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.
 
Return the ***maximum number*** of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [3,4,2]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation:
```
You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

```

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]`  
Output: `9`  
Explanation:
```
You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

## Intuition
This problem is really similar to House Robber, which would be helpful to
read up and solve before solving this problem. From the problem we know that
if we delete `nums[i]` we would also need to delete both `nums[i] + 1` and `nums[i] - 1`.
So in this case if we delete `nums[i]` we delete all instances of it along with all instances of
`nums[i] + 1` and `nums[i] - 1`. This is why it is similar to the House Robber problem. In this case
It would be helpful to know exactly how many instances of each number exists in the array `nums` so if]
we delete one instance we would delete their total value `num * cnt`.

In addition, we could also sort the input array so we could iterate through it just like the House Robber question
. At each index of the new array only containing unique numbers we are asking ourselves this question.
> at each index `i`:
> - For every item up to the current item `i` what is the maximum earning we could achieve from `nums[:i + 1]`?
> - At `i` we could either:
>   - delete `nums[i]`:
>       - This means that we could either add our earning from deleting our current `nums[i]` with the max earning achieved the number before `nums[i] - 1`, which is at `dp[i - 2]`.  
>       - Or we could just use the `max_pts` achievable only from deleting `nums[i]` at our current item
>       - Or if the item before which is at `dp[i - 1]`. If its number is not equal to `nums[i] - 1` then we could simply also consider the result of adding the max points achievable with our current number `nums[i]` with the max earning achievable from the previous item's number.
>   - not use `nums[i]`:
>       - This means that we aren't deleting the current `nums[i]` and we could just consider the max earning possible from the previous item's number which is at `dp[i - 1]`.

## Implementation
For the implementation we would first sort the input `nums` array and initialize a dictionary that counts all instances of each unique number within the array.  

Afterwards we would initialize another array `dp` which keeps track of both the number at the current index (which is in sorted ascending order) and also the maximum possible earning possible up to and including the current item's number at index `i`

At the very end we would return our answer at `dp[-1]`.

## Solution
```python
from collections import Counter
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        At i:
        - We can choose to earn or not earn it:
        """
        # Different approach 1D DP
        nums.sort()
        freq = Counter(nums)
        max_pts = dict()
        for num, cnt in freq.items():
            max_pts[num] = num * cnt
        dp = [[0, 0]]
        for num in freq.keys():
            dp.append([0, num])
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            earning, num = dp[i][0], dp[i][1]
            dp[i][0] = max(max_pts[num],
                           max_pts[num] + dp[i - 2][0],
                           max_pts[num] + (dp[i - 1][0] if num != dp[i - 1][1] + 1 else 0),
                           dp[i - 1][0])
        return dp[-1][0]
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input array `nums`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N \cdot log(N))$

Python uses TimeSort which takes in the worse case $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot log(N))$ to sort the input array `nums`

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Our `dp` array and `freq` hashmap would have in the worse case $N$ items which takes linear space.
