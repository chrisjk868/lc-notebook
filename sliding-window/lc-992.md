Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.

A good array is an array where the number of different integers in that array is exactly `k`.

For example, `[1,2,3,1,2]` has `3` different integers: `1`, `2`, and `3`.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example 1:**  

Input: `nums = [1,2,1,2,3], k = 2`  
Output: `7`  
Explanation: `Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,1,2]`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `nums = [1,2,1,3,4], k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: `Subarrays formed with exactly 3 different integers: [1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4].`

## Intuition
For this problem we could also consider a sliding window approach. This is because we are also trying to find contiguous chunks of an array that satisfies a given condition. And we could do this by keeping track of important information we have about our current window.

In the beginning, we can't seem to decide on when is the best time to shrink or expand our window. Let's consider the following scenarios:

1. If our current window already has `k` different integers
2. If our current window has more than `k` different integers
3. If our current window has less than `k` different integers
