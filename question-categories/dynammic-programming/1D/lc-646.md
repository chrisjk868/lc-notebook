You are given an array of `n` pairs `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [left_i, right_i]` and `left_i < right_i`.

A pair `p2 = [c, d]` follows a pair `p1 = [a, b]` if `b < c`. A chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Return the *length longest* chain which can be formed.

You do not need to use up all the given intervals. You can select pairs in any order.

**Example 1:**  

Input: `pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4].`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `pairs = [[1,2],[7,8],[4,5]]`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: `The longest chain is [1,2] -> [4,5] -> [7,8].`

## Intuition
For this question, we can consider dynamic programming because of 2 essential reasons.  
**Overlapping Subproblems**  
- For chain `[left_i, right_i]` what is are the longest chain lengths formed at `[left_j, right_j]` such that $0 \leq right_j \lt left_i$ and we can ask ourselves this question for every `[left_i, right_i]`
   
**Optimal Substructure**  
- For every chain what is the longest possible chain length that could be formed before?

After looking at these 2 essential traits of the problem we can see that in order to apply dynamic programming we should also agree on the appropriate ordering of the chains itself in order to apply DP, and prompt ourselves correctly for every `[left_i, right_i]` chain.

We agree that for every chain `[left_i, right_i]` we want to know the maximal chain length that could be formed formed for `[left_j, right_j]` s.t. $0 \leq right_j \lt left_i$. Therefore in order for our state transition to work correctly we need to correctly what the previous **chain** is, and this is very crucial.

With this information in mind we could agree to sort every chain `[left_i, right_i]` in `pairs` by `right_i` in ascending or non-decreasing order. This is because we want to figure out what the maximal possible chain length that could be formed by the chain with the minimal endpoint `right_i`. And as we iterate could be sure to always look at the chain before which is guaranteed to have endpoints that are less than the current `right_i`. 

As we check the chain lengths that precede the current chain. We want to make sure that the condition 
`pairs[i][0] > pairs[j][1]` is satisfied because this ensures that for the current chain at `i`,`left_i > right_j` as they can't overlap in order for their result to be considered. 

So for our `dp` array at every index `i` we are essentially asking ourselves the question. What is the longest chain length that could be formed ending with the current chain `[left_i, right_i]`, which gives us the following state transition.

For every i, j ~ $[i,j] \in { \{0 \leq i \lt j\} }$  

> **At i:**  
> 
> $$
> dp(i) =
> \begin{cases}
> 1 + \max(dp(i), 1 + dp(j)) & \text{if } pairs[i]_{left} \gt pairs[j]_{right}\\
> 0 & \text{if } dp(i, j) = 0
> \end{cases}
> $$

> **At cell i, j:**
> 
> $$
> dp(i,j) =
> \begin{cases}
> 1 + \min(dp(i-1,j), dp(i,j-1), dp(i-1,j-1)) & \text{if } dp(i, j) = 1 \\
> 0 & \text{if } dp(i, j) = 0
> \end{cases}
> $$

## Implementation
For the implementation we could first sort the `pairs` as we mentioned. We could either do this in place or with extra space
in python, it doesn't really matter. 

Afterwards we can initalize a `dp` array which would store our answers for each chain.

Lastly, for iterating through `dp` we could use nested for loops to iterate forwards and at each iteration
look through previous results up until and not including the current `i`.

Finally, we would return the maximum length seen with `max(dp)` as the maximum length could exist in
any `pairs[i]` because the individual chains could overlap each other.

---
## Solution
```python
def findLongestChain(self, pairs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Sort by right in increasing order
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
    dp = [1] * len(pairs)
    for i in range(1, len(dp)):
        for j in range(i):
            if pairs[i][0] > pairs[j][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being in the size of input `pairs`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

The runtime for sorting is $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot \log(N))$ which is less than the actually computational
runtime complexity of iterating through `dp` and computing each `pairs[i]`'s longest possible chain length
which yields worse case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ 

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Space is linear because the space for `dp` would have at most $N$ elements.
