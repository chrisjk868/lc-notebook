There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:

- The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
- At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.  

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.

**Example 1:**  

Input: `s = "aaabbb"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `Print 'aaa' first then print 'bbb'.`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `s = "aba"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.`
