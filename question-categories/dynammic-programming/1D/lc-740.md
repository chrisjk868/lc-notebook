You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and every element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.
 
Return the ***maximum number*** of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [3,4,2]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation:
```
You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

```

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]`  
Output: `9`  
Explanation:
```
You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.

## Solution
```python
from collections import Counter
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        At i:
        - We can choose to earn or not earn it:
        """
        # Different approach 1D DP
        nums.sort()
        freq = Counter(nums)
        max_pts = dict()
        for num, cnt in freq.items():
            max_pts[num] = num * cnt
        dp = [[0, 0]]
        for num in freq.keys():
            dp.append([0, num])
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            earning, num = dp[i][0], dp[i][1]
            dp[i][0] = max(max_pts[num],
                           max_pts[num] + dp[i - 2][0],
                           max_pts[num] + (dp[i - 1][0] if num != dp[i - 1][1] + 1 else 0),
                           dp[i - 1][0])
        return dp[-1][0]
```
