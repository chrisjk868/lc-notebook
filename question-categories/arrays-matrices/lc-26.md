Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.  
- Return `k`.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums =[1,1,2]`  
Output: `2, nums = [1,2,_]`  
Explanation: `Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).`  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`  
Output: `5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]`  
Explanation: `Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).`

## Solution
```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    target_ptr, sample_ptr = 0, 1
    while sample_ptr < len(nums):
        while sample_ptr < len(nums) and nums[target_ptr] == nums[sample_ptr]:
            sample_ptr += 1
        if sample_ptr < len(nums):
            if nums[target_ptr] != nums[sample_ptr]:
                target_ptr += 1
                nums[target_ptr] = nums[sample_ptr]
                sample_ptr += 1
        else:
            return target_ptr + 1
    return target_ptr + 1
```
