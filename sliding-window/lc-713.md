Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

---
**Example 1:**  

Input: `nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100`  
Output: `8`  
Explanation: `The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `nums = [1,2,3], k = 0`  
Output: `0`
