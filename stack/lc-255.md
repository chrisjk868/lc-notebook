Given an array of unique integers `preorder`, return `true` if it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

**Example 1:**  

![ lc 255 example 1 ](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/preorder-tree.jpg)

Input: `preorder = [5,2,1,3,6]`  
Output: `true`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `preorder = [5,2,6,1,3]`  
Output: `false`

## Intuition
This question is quite hard to explain with words, it is best for me to illustrate the thought process for this question. The implementation is very simple but the logic behind this problem is more complex.

Firstly, let us look at the BST invariant:
For a `node`:
- All values in `node.left` is smaller than `node.val`
- All values in `node.right` is greater than `node.val`

## Solution
```python
from collections import deque
def verifyPreorder(self, preorder: List[int]) -> bool:
    min_limit = -inf
    stack = deque()
    # Maintain a monotonically decreasing stack
    # The stack represents everything that is to the left hand side of the tree
    # When we append to stack we are visitng the (left child) of the node on top of the stack
    # When we pop from the stack we have finished visiting the left subtree of the popped node
    # As soon as we find a node with value that is larger

    for num in preorder:
        while stack and num > stack[-1]:
            min_limit = stack.pop()
        if num <= min_limit:
            return False
        stack.append(num)
    return True
```
