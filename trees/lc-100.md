Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**  

![example 1 image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg)

Input: `p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]`  
Output: `true`  

**Example 2:**  

![example 2 image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

Input: `p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]`  
Output: `false`  

**Example 3:**  

![example 3 image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

Input: `p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]`  
Output: `false`

## Intuition
Although this problem is marked as an easy, for me it was still quite hard to visualize and implement as I am pretty lacking in terms of recursion.

For this problem we should keep track of three main requirements:
> **At each node $p'$ of tree $p$ and each node $q'$ of tree $q$:**
> 1. The current node value has to be the same as the other `p.val == q.val`
> 2. The left subtrees of both trees must be the same `p.left == q.left`
> 3. The right subtrees of both trees must be the same `p.right == q.right`
> ---

Whenever it comes down to tree problems we are wither going to use one of the three traversal methods of DFS or BFS. For DFS there are three further traversal orders of preorder, inorder or postorder traversal. For this problem, we could consider a preorder traversal using DFS for traversing both `p` and `q` trees. 

**Base Cases**
> 1. First base case would be that we reached the leaf nodes of both trees `p` and `q`  
> -> In this case we would return `True` because structurally the tree is consistent at this point.
> 2. Second base case would be that we reached the leaf node of either tree `p` or `q` but the other isn't a leaf node.
> -> In this case we would return `False` as structurally the tree is inconsistent at this point.
> ---

At the very end of each iteration of each recursive call after we have confirmed that both the left and right subtrees agree with each other in terms of both structure and values, we would need confirm that the current `p` node's value is also same as the other `q` node's value. If all of these statements hold true then we would return `True` else we would return `False` to the previous recursive call in the stack.

---
## Implementation
The implementation would be straightforward with DFS preorder traversal, where we would traverse left for `p` and `q` and right for for `p` and `q` at the same time. This is because we are making sure that both left and right of both trees match up.

In terms of the base cases, for tree problems we can think of leaf nodes as having both left and right childs as `None`. And when we actually reach a leaf node the code would actually traverse into the `None` node.

With tree problems we could also think of nodes in terms of:
>  - If the current node is not `None` it must either have a parent or is the root node  
>  - If the current node is `None` it must have a parent that is either a leaf node or a node with either a left subtree or right subtree alone.

## Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    # Check if tree is the same with dfs traversal
    def dfs(p, q):
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        elif (not p and q) or (p and not q):
            return False
        l = dfs(p.left, q.left)
        r = dfs(p.right, q.right)
        return (p.val == q.val) and (l and r)
    return dfs(p, q)
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the maximum number of nodes in either the tree `p` or `q`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Since we are using DFS the worse case for traversing an unbalanced tree is just like traversing a linked list, and we are only visiting each node exactly once.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

We are visiting each node exactly once and we would only need to maintain a call stack of size $N$ for an unbalanced tree as we make $N$ recursive calls with DFS traversal.
