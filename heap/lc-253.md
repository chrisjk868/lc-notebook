Given an array of meeting time `intervals` intervals where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

---
**Example 1:**  

Input: `intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`  
Output: `2`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]`  
Output: `1`

## Intuition
For this problem it doesn't really matter which room is free or not. As long as a room is free we could always use it. The only problem really arises when no rooms are free and when we need to assign a new room to fill in for a specific meeting in `intervals`.

In this case, we want to always get the earliest room that is available which would be open for new meetings as we schedule each meeting chronologically. Logically speaking we want meetings with earlier start times to be prioritized first.

This means that we could first sort the given `intervals` array by start time first and afterwards process each interval one by one.

Before we iterate through our `intervals` array we would also initialize a heap which keeps track of the earliest available room, ordered by their end times. This means we would want a min heap to achieve this purpose.

As we iterate through our sorted `intervals` array for our current `[start_i, end_i]` if we see that for our current interval `start_i` is larger than our interval in the heap with the earliest end time `end_h`. This means the interval within the min heap with the earliest end time could be removed from the heap and replaced with the current `[start_i, end_i]`. 

We could think of the current intervals within the min heap as the rooms that are already currently occupied. So if could replace the room in our min heap with the minimal end time with the current interval `[start_i, end_i]` this means that we could use that room as soon as the meeting ends for our current interval.

However, in the case where `start_i < end_h` this means that there are current no rooms available in our min heap for our current meeting to take up as our current interval's start time is larger than every meeting rooms end times. Therefore we would need to add one more room to `rooms` and insert that interval into our min heap.

---
## Implementation
Initialize a min heap `min_heap`, sort the given `intervals` by the start times of each interval. Afterwards iterate through our `intervals` array and add to `rooms` if necessary. At the very end return `rooms`.

---
## Solution
```python
import heapq
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # 1 conference room could only host 1 meeting at a time
    # You want to fit as many disjoint meetings into 1 room as much as possible
    # Count insertions into min heap
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x:x[0])
    rooms = 0
    for start, end in intervals:
        if not min_heap:
            rooms += 1
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, [end, start])
        else:
            # Get the earliest available room
            e, s = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            if e <= start:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, [end, start])
            else:
                rooms += 1
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, [end, start])
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, [e, s])
    return rooms
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of input array `intervals`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N \cdot log(N))$

Sorting the `intervals` would take $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot log(N))$ time.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

The `min_heap` would have at most $N$ elements, hence space is linear.
