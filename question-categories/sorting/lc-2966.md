You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size `3` satisfying the following conditions:

- Each element of `nums` should be in exactly one array.  
- The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to `k`.  

Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Example 1:**  
Input: ```nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2```  
Output: ```[[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]```  
Explanation: 
```We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].```  
```The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.```  
```Note that the order of elements is not important.```  

**Example 2:**  
Input: ```nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3```  
Output: ```[]```  
Explanation: 
```It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.```

## Intuition
Since we are dividing a an array up into subarrays of fixed sizes this really simplifies the problem. My first intuition is to sort the array in ascending order and process the array accordingly.

Since the array must be split into subarrays of size 3 and each element in the original could only appear in each subarray exactly once, we could process the sorted array in 3s and see if we could divide the array up accordingly.

As the array is already sorted in ascending order we can simply just look at every first and third element as we have the guarantee that $nums[i] \leq nums[i+2]$ in the range of `nums[i:i+3]`. So if we look at the difference between the maximum and minimum of this 3 number interval if their difference is $(nums[i + 2] - nums[i]) \leq k$ then this means that anything in between would yield a difference less than `k`.

---
## Implementation
The implementation is pretty straightforward. In this case I decided to use a while loop instead of a for loop because it made things easier for me to visualize with 2 pointers. One pointer that points at the `start_idx` of an interval and another that points at the `end_idx` of an interval.

This way we could just iterate through the `nums` array, and isolate at looking at intervals with exactly 3 elements in them. In each iteration we calculate the precondition mentioned before where `(nums[end_idx] - nums[start_idx]) <= k$`. If this condition is met we could append everything in `nums[start_idx:end_idx+1]` to our `ans` array. At the very end return the `ans` array.

---
## Solution
```python
def divideArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    ans = []
    i = 0
    start, end = True, False
    start_idx, end_idx = 0, 0
    nums.sort()
    while i < len(nums):
        if start:
            start_idx = i
            i += 2
            start, end = False, True
        if end:
            end_idx = i
            if abs(nums[start_idx] - nums[end_idx]) <= k:
                ans.append(nums[start_idx : end_idx + 1])
            else:
                return []
            i += 1
            start, end = True, False
    return ans
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being the size of the ```nums``` array.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N \cdot log(N))$

Because we need to sort the input `nums` array.

Space Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N)$

Linear space because we are only appending results into `ans` and that would have a max size of $\frac{N}{3}$.
