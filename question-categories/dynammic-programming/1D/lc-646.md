You are given an array of `n` pairs `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [left_i, right_i]` and `left_i < right_i`.

A pair `p2 = [c, d]` follows a pair `p1 = [a, b]` if `b < c`. A chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Return the *length longest* chain which can be formed.

You do not need to use up all the given intervals. You can select pairs in any order.

**Example 1:**  

Input: `pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: `The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4].`  

**Example 2:**  

Input: `pairs = [[1,2],[7,8],[4,5]]`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: `The longest chain is [1,2] -> [4,5] -> [7,8].`

## Intuition
For this question, we can consider dynamic programming because of 2 essential reasons.  
**Overlapping Subproblems**  
- For chain `[left_i, right_i]` what is are the chain lengths formed at `[left_j, right_j]` such that $0 \leq right_j \lt left_i$ and we can ask ourselves this question for every `[left_i, right_i]`
   
**Optimal Substructure**  
- For every chain what is the longest possible chain length that could be formed before?

## Solution
```python
def findLongestChain(self, pairs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Sort by right in increasing order
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
    dp = [1] * len(pairs)
    for i in range(1, len(dp)):
        for j in range(i):
            if pairs[i][0] > pairs[j][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

## Runtime & Space Complexity
$N$ ~ being in the size of input `pairs`.  

Runtime Complexity:  
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
